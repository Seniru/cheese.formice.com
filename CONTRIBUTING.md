# Contributing to CheeseForMice

I'm glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers. Thank you for taking your time to contribute.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to CheeseForMice, either frontend or backend services, which are hosted in the [CheeseForMice organization](https://github.com/cheeseformice) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### Did you find a bug?

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching under [Issues](https://github.com/cheeseformice/cheese.formice.com/issues)

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/cheeseformice/cheese.formice.com/issues/new). Make sure to include a title and clear description, and as much relevant information as possible.

### Do you have any suggestion for the website or API?

* Head over to our [discord server](https://discord.gg/xeRNaKTKxN) and discuss it there.

### Did you write a new feature, modification, bug fix, or updated/added translations for the website or API?

* Open a new GitHub pull request in its corresponding repository (the API is hosted [here](https://github.com/cheeseformice/backend))

* Ensure the PR description is clear and precise about the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Unless that fix comes with a proper pull request (anything that falls under the previous category), this change will be most likely rejected.

Thank you!
